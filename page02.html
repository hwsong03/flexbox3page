            <h3 class="subTitle">The Impact on Biodiversity</h3>
            <p>Wildlife trafficking severely threatens the biodiversity of our planet. Many species, when removed from their natural habitats, can't survive. Others, even if they do survive, may not be able to reproduce, leading to a decrease in their populations. Biodiversity is essential because each species plays a role in the ecosystem, providing different services like pollination of plants or control of pests. Disrupting this balance can lead to unforeseen consequences.</p>

            <h3 class="subTitle">Organized Crime & Trafficking</h3>
            <p>The illegal wildlife trade is the fourth most lucrative global crime after drugs, humans, and arms. Organized crime syndicates and rebel groups use the wildlife trade to fund activities, with profits sometimes used to buy weapons. The global value of the illegal wildlife trade is estimated between $7 and $23 billion a year. These operations often exploit impoverished communities, luring locals with promises of high income for poaching activities, thus also leading to socio-economic disruptions.</p>

            <h3 class="subTitle">Conservation Efforts</h3>
            <p>Efforts to combat wildlife trafficking have increased in the past decades. National governments, international organizations, and NGOs are working collaboratively to improve law enforcement, promote public awareness, and develop community-based wildlife conservation initiatives. By supporting sustainable livelihoods, communities can benefit from wildlife resources without depleting them. Technological solutions like DNA analysis and tracking devices are also being employed to monitor and protect endangered species.</p>
